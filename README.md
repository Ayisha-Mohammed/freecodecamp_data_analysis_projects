 A calculator that returns the mean, variance, standard deviation, min, max, and sum for a 3x3 matrix based on a list of 9 numbers using NumPy.

### 2. Demographic Data Analyzer
 Analyzes demographic data from a CSV file to answer questions like race distribution, average age, education impact on income, work hours, and country-based statistics.

### 3. Medical Data Visualizer
 Cleans and visualizes patient medical data using a categorical plot and a heatmap to detect correlations and trends.

### 4. Page View Time Series Visualizer

### 5. Sea Level Predictor
 Predicts sea level rise using linear regression based on historical data from 1880â€“2013 and visualizes future trends through 2050.
